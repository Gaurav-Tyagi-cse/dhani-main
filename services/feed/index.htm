			<h3>Importance of a Good Spine Support Mattress</h3>
<p>It is an age-old fact that you spend about one-third of your life sleeping or at least trying to sleep. Sleep is one of the most vital functions of the body that provide adequate rest to the mind and body. Without sufficient sleep, the brain will not be able to function properly, all the while also increasing the risk of many psychological and physical diseases. But while a mattress can relieve back pains, the wrong mattress can also cause back pains and disrupt the natural alignment of your spine. This is why you specifically need a spine support mattress.</p>
<p>For a better understanding, here are some signs that your mattress is the root cause of your back problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your mattress is either too hard or too soft :</strong> A hard mattress for back pain can cause joint pressure and a mattress that is too soft can hinder the spine from maintaining a neutral position while you sleep.</li>
<li><strong>You wake up feeling tired or experience unexplained body pains in the morning :</strong> When you sleep in rigid sleeping positions throughout the night, you are more likely to wake up with neck spasms and back pains in the morning.</li>
<li><strong>You have interrupted or disturbed sleep throughout the night :</strong> Tossing and turning all night will contribute to improper and inadequate sleep which in turn contributes to more rigidity in the muscles, joints and back.</li>
<li><strong>Your mattress is old, uneven or saggy :</strong> Old, saggy and uneven mattress can directly affect your spine health. Experts suggest that a mattress should be replaced every 8-9 years. This is because mattresses tend to wear out since they are constantly adapting to our changing body weight, bone density and different sleep cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Your mattress is relatively new :</strong> If your back pains are a new concern and you have just switched mattresses, chances are your body needs more time to adapt to the new sleeping surface. Give it some more time but keep a close eye on persistent body and back pains.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to a good mattress for back pains, preference comes first. You may, however, need to consider choosing the right materials that compliments your preference. In response to the above-mentioned factors, here are some things to consider before buying a good mattress for back pain to ensure optimum support and comfort:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory Foam or Natural Latex :</strong> Most mattress manufacturing companies market coir mattresses as doctor recommended “orthopedic mattresses for back pain” but this is highly misleading. Infact, sleep experts rarely recommend coir mattresses for back pains. This is because a hard mattress for back pain is made with foam and coconut husks which are likely to be too “firm” and uncomfortable. Additionally, these mattresses are heavy and saggy. They may provide some support initially, but they are not durable and become uneven in a few years.<br />
The best back support mattresses are natural latex and memory foam mattresses as they are ergonomically designed to improve sleeping posture, blood circulation and distribute the body weight evenly to collectively give you a good night’s rest which in turn reduces back pain drastically.</li>
<li><strong>Mattress Material :</strong> Memory foam and natural latex mattresses are two of the best orthopedic mattress for back pain in India. While both of them offer supreme support to the back, you may have to list down some pros and cons depending on your preferences. For instance, memory foam is not ideally natural and consists of polyurethane and some added chemicals that increase its viscosity while natural latex is more eco-friendly and provides excellent air circulation. Memory foam tends to offer better pressure relief while Natural Latex is the best in durability.</li>
<li><strong>Mattress Thickness :</strong> Ideally, the best orthopedic mattress for back pain in India are sold in 5, 6, and 8 inches of thickness. What is best suitable for you, depends on your body weight. If you weigh less than 60 kgs, a 5 inch mattress would suit you well. If you weigh between 60-80 kgs, you should opt for a 6 inch mattress. Lastly, if you weigh more than 80 kgs, you should consider going for an 8 inch mattress.</li>
<li><strong>Size :</strong>The size of the mattress depends on whether you have a partner. If your partner tosses a lot during the night, we would recommend a double-sized natural latex mattress as it isolates motion transfer. However, if you still want a memory foam mattress, you can opt for two single mattresses and club them together.</li>
</ul>

                                    “It is a good mattress
- Supports body pretty well
- It is a medium firm. Little softer than the other popular brands but yet supports the body pretty well.
- Do not expect luxury hotels sink-in kind of mattresses (which I personally find uncomfortable).
- One interesting advantage that I saw of this mattress is that they can be rolled and packed. Other popular foam mattresses are rigid and moving them around (relocation etc.) is a hassle.
Overall, quite satisfied with the product and would never go back to the established mattress brands.

I did a lot of research online regarding foam and spring mattress and finalized on foam because of its orthopaedic benefits. I got this for just 5.7k for the 5 inches one which is a steal deal. Nowhere outside you'll get for so cheap. Back support is excellent and I am getting real good sleep on this one. Even my parents who were initially skeptical about this "low priced" mattress are singing praises now!! Hope this unbiased review helps.”

                                    “First of all, I was really amazed to see the extremely compact packing of the mattress. I had never imagined that an 8 inch double bed mattress can be compressed and reduced to such a portable size. The packaging was incredibly practical and impressive.

Secondly, the mattress is really very comfortable. I like the way the foam takes body shape when one is resting on it. I have been having much better and deeper sleep since the day I started using this mattress.

Kudos to the Emma mattress team!

<p>The credit card EMI is similar to the debit card EMI except with the benefit of having a 0% interest EMI for a short duration. The credit card also gives you cashbacks based on policies and the amount spent. Ideally, if you can repay the amount within the zero interest timeline, it becomes a better option than Debit card EMI.</p>

			<h3>Best TVs in India Under 30000</h3>
<p>Are you looking to buy a TV under 30000? Despite the launch of smartphones around the world, the best experience of watching shows is still unmatched on good television. As soon as the boring work hours get over, the best thing is to sit on that comfy couch and watch your favorite show on your television. But why choose to buy a TV under 30000? The range is both affordable and offers a high-quality experience for you and your family!</p>
<p>Some of the best TVs under 30000 offer 4K resolution, LED TV, and much more. Not just that, there are some of the best smart TVs under 30000 that allow you to watch Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime, and every other OTT platform directly on your television.</p>
<h3>What to Consider When Buying a new TV</h3>
<p>There are several options available when looking for TVs in India under 30000. But what suits you and your loved ones the best? Are you fond of an out-of-the-world experience? So, you should check out the best 4K TVs under 30000. Do you like the slim looks of a TV? Then you should go for an LED TV under 30000.</p>
<p>In case you have a geeky bone and wish to get the feel of a computer on your television, an android TV under 30000 is your answer! Now you know that there is a lot that you need to check before buying yourself a new television. Let’s check out what to consider when buying a new TV.</p>
<h5>Screen Size</h5>
<p>One of the most important decisions before choosing a good television is choosing its screen size. While you can find televisions of any size, a big screen TV gives you a great watching experience and stands out in your living room. However, you cannot even buy a very large television for a small room, making it look very much out of proportion. You can easily buy a 43 inch, 50 inches and 55 inch TV under 30000 that will look good in your room and not hurt your pocket either.</p>
<h5>Screen Type</h5>
<p>There are different types of screens available today that offer you different viewing experiences. As years have passed, the quality of television screens has improved. Along with the old designs of LCD and plasma televisions, today companies offer LED, QLED and OLED type designs. While a QLED and OLED type television can be very expensive, you can easly get some of the best LED TVs under 30000.</p>
<h5>Cost of Television</h5>
<p>The most important part of buying anything is the cost! Isn’t it. You must make sure that you not only get the best deal for your television but the product should also come out as investment. When it comes to buying a TV under 30000, you cannot go wrong as the range offers you quality products and is fairly affordable as well. Now, let’s check out some of the best TVs under 30000.</p>
<h5>Smart TV or Not?</h5>
<p>As the world progresses, so do our televisions. You can find some of the best android TVs in India under 30000. However, the question is, if you really need a smart TV? The best part of a smart TV is that it allows you the experience of both a normal TV and a laptop where you watch your shows on the OTT platforms. A smart TV will also allow you to watch any show at any time of the day instead of having to wait for the speculated time. However, if you are not digitally adept or do not want a complicated way around your television, a regular TV is a great option. It helps you to navigate through your favorite shows in the seamless way possible, allowing people of every age to be able to access them.</p>

			<p>When we speak of a high-class monitor, we tend to think of the screen resolution first. So, on that front, the ASUS gaming monitor comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 and free sync, which is not bad at all.</p>
<p>One of the best gaming monitors under 20000, its screen has some minor issues as the pictures may look a bit washed out when viewing them for the first time. But once you grow used to it, you will begin appreciating the response time of 1ms and the dynamic contrast. As the speakers are mediocre, the overall volume tends to be low. It primarily is a product meant for gaming only. So, if you’re a gamer, then this monitor has an amazing display with loud and clear sound linked to HDMI.</p>

<p>Purchase top bluetooth speakers under 2000 with debit card EMI! Depending on the duration of repayment, the rate of interest and your EMI amount shall be decided. The Debit card EMI deducts the EMI amount from your account directly on the date of repayment.</p>

<p>The credit card EMI is similar to the debit card EMI except with the benefit of having a 0% interest EMI for a short duration. The credit card also gives you cashbacks based on policies and the amount spent. Ideally, if you can repay the amount within the zero interest timeline, it becomes a better option than Debit card EMI.</p>

			<h3>Overview on Best Electric Scooter under 50000</h3>
<p>Electric bikes are becoming increasingly popular amongst our generation. Be it young adults, cost conscious or environmentally conscious individuals, electric scooters have managed to find a place in everyone’s heart, thanks to its energy saving, money saving and planet friendly characteristics. According to studies, electric bikes are upto three times cheaper than petrol cars and upto 10 times cheaper than petrol bikes!</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to list down some of the biggest advantages of electric scooters, along with a detailed list of the best electric scooter under 50000, so you can bring home one of these powerful beasts at a very affordable price and surprise every member of your family! So without ado, let’s get to the advantages of electric scooters.</p>
<h5>Advantages of Electric Scooters</h5>
<p>Most petrol scooters need fuel or petrol to function. They have an internal combustion engine, which generates petrol into energy and runs the scooter. The biggest advantage of electric scooters is that they run on electricity, (i.e) they need to be charged with electricity and can be used depending on the charged battery. Since it is chargeable, electric scooters do not possess any threat to the environment.</p>
<p>For your better understanding, here are some of the advantages of investing in an electric scooter for your family:</p>
<h5>&#8211; Environment</h5>
<p>Petrol bikes generally emit dangerous carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and pollute the environment. Electric scooters, on the other hand, do not harm the environment. Since they derive power from electric BLDC/AC induction motors, they deliver the peak torque from 0 &#8211; 200 rpm itself. This means that they emit very little release of toxic gases like carbon monoxide (upto 50% less when compared to petrol bikes) and also emit very less noise while running. In this sense, electric motors are far better than petrol bikes, with regard to acceleration, performance and being eco-friendly.</p>
<h5>&#8211; Cost</h5>
<p>An electric scooter below 50000 will also continue to save you a lot of money in the long run, since they do not require any petrol to function. E-scooters can run at 10–20 paise per km while petrol scooters run at 1.5 rs/km. This means that e-scooters are a whopping 90% cheaper than petrol scooters!</p>
<h5>&#8211; Maintenance</h5>
<p>Electric scooters are easier to maintain since they don’t possess filters like air or fuel filters or other components like engine oils. They only require lubrication and motor rewinding after many years of use. Petrol engines comparatively require higher maintenance every 5000 km to 15000 km. Furthermore, thanks to regenerative braking, the brake pad maintenance is also very less in E-scooters.</p>
<h5>&#8211; No Licence Required</h5>
<p>Most electric scooters do not need to be registered, insured or taxed. Many of them don’t even need a driver’s licence. This is because a majority of the electric scooters are powered by a 250-watt motor that delivers a top speed of only 25 kmph. Such low-speed vehicles are perfect for youngsters or anyone who needs a lightweight quick-ride without getting stuck in the city’s horrendous traffic.</p>

			<p>Selecting the best projector for home in India can be a daunting task. But with brands like Myra, the selection becomes much easier. So goes for Myra TouYinger X7 as well, a classic LED projector with a brightness of 1800 lumens. The optical resolution of this projector varies from 800 x 600 dpi to 1080p while the aspect ratio of the screen is 4:3/16:9 ratio. Also, the projector’s screen size can be anywhere between 37-130 inches. The 3D performance is good enough for personal purposes, but will not be at par for professional usage such as in offices, schools and colleges.</p>
<p>One of the best projectors for homes under 10000, Myra TouYinger X7 is portable and has a lamp LED hour of up to 20,000 hours with a contrast ratio of 1000:1. It does not support hard disks or pen drives but only USB. Many features of this product cater to personal use rather than professional use. For users who require elegant and easy-to-operate projectors, this will make for a good choice. It is one of the cheapest 4k projector available in the market.</p>
<p>Price of Myra® TouYinGer X7 Led 1800 Lumens Projector is INR 8,790</p>

			<h3>The Best Sports Bike in India &#8211; All you need to know!</h3>
<p>Cycling has become an extremely popular activity in India, especially post the COVID-19 induced lockdown. Akin to running, cycling is a great workout that is super fun and also helps you stay in shape. And what makes it even better is that it is completely eco-friendly!</p>
<p>Now whether you’re looking to shed a few extra kilos or are simply looking for a fun Sunday ride with your friends, you would definitely want to buy only the best sports bike. Well, fret not, we’ve got just what you need &#8211; a complete overview of the different sports bikes available in India in your budget.</p>
<p>Some of the key factors you must keep in mind before buying sports bikes under 1 lakh include ride stability, geared/non-geared, tire durability and the type of sports bike.</p>
<p>Sports bikes essentially come in three varieties, (i) road bikes, (ii) mountain bikes and (iii) hybrids. Road bikes, as the name suggests, are best-suited for drives on paved roads and are ideal for those who enjoy fast rides. These sports bikes are light, come with thin tyres and are made for speed. Mountain bikes, on the other hand, provide increased stability and better durability for rough surfaces. They are great for Indian roads and are heavier than road bikes. Hybrid bikes, one of the best types of sports bikes, are a combination of the two &#8211; they are ideal for those who want to go fast and also ride on not-so-smooth surfaces.</p>

You can easily buy the best bike under 2 lakhs by using your debit card. You can simply swipe your card at the counter at the store or use online banking if you’re shopping on your phone. In case you want to make the payment in instalments, then you can opt for an EMI option where the money will be deducted, with an added interest, each month on the date chosen by you.</div> <!-- description --></div> <!-- aio-icon-box --></div> <!-- aio-icon-component --><div class="aio-icon-component    style_1"><div id="Info-box-wrap-2800" class="aio-icon-box default-icon" style=""  ><div class="aio-icon-default"><div class="ult-just-icon-wrapper  "><div class="align-icon" style="text-align:center;">

A credit card works along the same lines as a debit card, with the key difference being that there is the advantage of a 0% interest rate for a stipulated period. However, you are likely to get a few benefits if you use a credit card to buy bikes under 2 lakhs as different banks provide interesting incentives such as discounts on allied services, cashback or other benefits.</div> <!-- description --></div> <!-- aio-icon-box --></div> <!-- aio-icon-component -->

<p>Platforms such as Smule and Tik Tok skyrocketed in terms of popularity over the last two years when people were largely forced to remain indoors.

			<p>This device from Boya is a very good microphone for singing at home. Boya makes some top-notch microphones and this one is very versatile and can be used for a host of purposes including vlogging, podcasts, interviews and for singing too.</p>
<p>This professional mic for singing is an omnidirectional lapel mic that is best suited for smartphones, DSLR cameras, camcorders and the like. It runs on a tiny battery and can be connected to your device with a simple AUX cable. The advantage of this mic is that it has an ultra-long 6-metre connecting cable that gives you enough room to move around.</p>
<p>It comes with a noise-cancelling wind muff and a clothing clip that lets you clip it onto your clothes with ease. In addition to this, it also has a switch that lets you change the recording setting from smartphone to camera, depending on your recording device. What’s more, the -10db switch eliminates background noise altogether and makes this a fantastic microphone for singing at home.</p>
